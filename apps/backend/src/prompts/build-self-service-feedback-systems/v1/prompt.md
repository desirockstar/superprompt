Adopt the role of an expert Voice of the Customer (VoC) program manager who specializes in designing feedback loops for self-service channels. Your primary objective is to create a comprehensive, actionable feedback collection system that captures meaningful signal from customer interactions with help centers, chatbots, and automated systems in a complete implementation-ready format. You understand that self-service feedback must measure resolution, not just satisfaction, and that feedback without action is worthless. Design a system that balances capturing rich signal with respecting customer attention, ensures feedback flows into clear action pathways, and provides the exact mechanisms, copy, taxonomies, and processes needed for immediate implementation. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Begin by analyzing each self-service channel individually and designing channel-specific feedback mechanisms that respect the unique context of each interaction. For knowledge base articles, implement binary resolution tracking with a "Did this solve your problem? Yes / No" prompt at the bottom of every article. When customers click No, present exactly one follow-up question: "What were you trying to do?" with four pre-set options (article was unclear, article was outdated, article didn't cover my issue, I need to talk to a person) plus an optional free-text field limited to 200 characters. Never use 1-5 rating scales for self-service content—binary resolution data is far more actionable.

For chatbot interactions, place a single question at the end of every conversation: "Was this helpful?" with thumbs up/down options. If the customer gives thumbs down on a resolved conversation, immediately ask "What would have been more helpful?" with a free-text field capped at 200 characters. If the conversation escalated to a human agent, do not ask for feedback on the bot—the escalation itself is the signal you need.

For community forums, track implicit feedback signals rather than adding intrusive survey prompts: monitor threads marked as resolved versus abandoned, measure time to first response, and track whether original posters responded with confirmation that solutions worked. Send a monthly 2-question email survey only to the top 20% most active community contributors to gather deeper insights without disrupting the community experience.

For IVR systems, after a self-service completion (such as checking order status), offer exactly one CSAT question: "Were you able to get what you needed today? Press 1 for yes, 2 for no." Never extend IVR surveys beyond one question—completion rates drop below 5% after the second question.

Create a unified feedback aggregation framework that normalizes data from all channels into a single view. Design a tagging taxonomy that works across all channels with these categories: content quality, content gap, UX issue, product bug, and feature request. Specify the exact data fields captured from each channel: channel source, timestamp, customer segment (if identifiable), interaction type, resolution status, feedback response, and free-text content. Present this taxonomy as a structured table showing how each channel maps to these standardized fields.

Define a three-tier analysis cadence with specific responsibilities and decision triggers. Weekly: produce a quick-scan report of negative feedback spikes and emerging themes, automated wherever possible, reviewed by the support operations lead to identify urgent issues. Monthly: conduct deep analysis of self-service resolution rates by channel and content category, flagging the top 10 underperforming resources for revision, reviewed by the content team and product managers to prioritize improvements. Quarterly: perform strategic review mapping feedback trends to product, content, and process improvements, presented to leadership to inform roadmap decisions. For each cadence, specify exactly what data gets reviewed, who reviews it, and what decisions it should inform.

Establish a closed-loop process that converts feedback into action. Define clear thresholds and workflows: when a knowledge base article receives negative feedback above 30%, it automatically enters a revision queue with a 5-business-day SLA for completion. When a chatbot flow receives repeated thumbs-down signals on the same intent, trigger an immediate flow review by the conversational design team. Create an escalation path for feedback revealing product bugs, specifying who gets notified (product manager, engineering lead), at what priority level (P1 for blockers, P2 for significant friction, P3 for minor issues), and within what timeframe they must respond.

Implement privacy and survey fatigue safeguards. Establish a rule that no single customer receives feedback prompts more than once per session across all channels. Specify the technical implementation (session-based cookie or identifier with 24-hour cooldown timer). Ensure GDPR and CCPA compliance by not collecting personal data in feedback fields without explicit consent—clearly outline what data is collected automatically (channel, timestamp, resolution status) versus what requires opt-in (email address for follow-up, account identifiers).

Avoid these common mistakes: using Net Promoter Score surveys in self-service contexts (NPS measures relationship strength, not task resolution—it's the wrong metric here), placing feedback prompts that interrupt customers before they've completed their task, collecting qualitative data without having resources to analyze it (be realistic about team capacity), and designing feedback systems that only measure satisfaction without measuring actual resolution.

#INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My self-service channels in use: [LIST ALL CHANNELS - e.g., "knowledge base, chatbot, community forum, IVR phone system, self-service portal for returns and billing"]
- My current feedback collection: [DESCRIBE CURRENT STATE - e.g., "thumbs up/down on help articles, nothing else" or "no formal feedback system"]
- My monthly self-service interactions: [APPROXIMATE VOLUME PER CHANNEL]
- My support team's biggest blind spot: [DESCRIBE - e.g., "we don't know if customers who use self-service are actually satisfied or just gave up and churned"]
- My plan for using the feedback: [DESCRIBE - e.g., "improve content, train chatbot, report to leadership, prioritize product fixes"]

MOST IMPORTANT!: Structure your output with clear component headings: (1) In-Moment Feedback Mechanisms with exact copy for every prompt across every channel, (2) Feedback Aggregation Framework presented as a structured table showing data fields and taxonomy, (3) Analysis Cadence with specific responsibilities and decision triggers for weekly/monthly/quarterly reviews, (4) Closed-Loop Process with thresholds, SLAs, and escalation paths, and (5) Privacy and Survey Fatigue Safeguards with technical implementation details. Format the entire system so a product operations team can implement it within one sprint.

## How to use the prompt

Analyzes self-service channels to create specific feedback prompts that measure if customers actually solved their problems. Builds a complete system that collects, organizes, and reports customer feedback across all self-service touchpoints. Establishes action workflows that turn negative feedback into concrete improvements with clear deadlines and responsibilities.
