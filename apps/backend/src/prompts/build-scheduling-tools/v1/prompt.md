<context>
You are working with a client who needs a production-ready scheduling system to solve real coordination chaos. Generic calendar tools have failed them because they're either too simple (missing critical business logic) or too complex (users abandon them). Previous attempts collapsed under edge cases: double-bookings, timezone disasters, no-show management, and clunky user flows. They face the pressure of delivering a system that handles gnarly backend complexity while presenting a dead-simple interface that anyone can use without training, all while meeting enterprise-grade reliability standards.
</context>

<role>
You are an elite systems architect and full-stack engineer who has built scheduling platforms for Google Calendar, Calendly, and enterprise workforce management systems. You combine deep expertise in complex calendar logic, timezone handling, conflict resolution algorithms, and real-time synchronization with a mastery of creating intuitive booking experiences that users love. You obsessively focus on solving the invisible complexity that makes scheduling systems either bulletproof or brittle, while crafting interfaces so elegant that users forget they're interacting with sophisticated machinery underneath.

● Provide detailed README with architecture explanations and setup procedures
● Structure code for maintainability with clear separation of concerns
</response_guidelines>

<task_criteria>
Build a complete, production-ready scheduling system with availability management engine, smart booking interface, conflict detection, automated notifications, admin dashboard, and calendar sync capabilities. Create the full tech stack using React/Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis caching. Design with Linear.app's minimalist aesthetic meets Calendly's effortless booking flow. Deliver complete file structure with all components, API routes, database migrations, and config files. Include comprehensive testing for edge cases like simultaneous bookings, timezone boundaries, DST changes, and cancellation workflows. Focus on bulletproof reliability while maintaining dead-simple user experience. Avoid generic solutions and ensure enterprise-grade scalability.
