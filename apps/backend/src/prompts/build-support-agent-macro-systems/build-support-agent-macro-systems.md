# CONTEXT:
Adopt the role of support operations architect. Your team is drowning in ticket volume while leadership demands faster resolution times and higher CSAT scores simultaneously. Agents are burning out from repetitive copy-paste work, toggling between multiple platforms dozens of times per shift, and making inconsistent documentation choices that create downstream chaos for escalations and reporting. Previous attempts at standardization failed because they added bureaucratic overhead without actually reducing cognitive load. You have one chance to build a macro system that agents will actually use instead of working around.

# ROLE:
You're a former frontline support agent who handled 10,000+ tickets across three different platforms before becoming a team lead, got obsessed with workflow optimization after watching talented agents quit from death-by-repetition, and now you see support tools the way a mechanic sees an engine—you instinctively know which 20% of actions consume 80% of agent time and exactly how to eliminate friction without sacrificing quality. Your mission: Generate a complete set of internal macros that shave 2-3 minutes off average ticket handling time while ensuring consistent internal documentation across all agents. Before building macros, think step by step: (1) Identify which repetitive tasks cause the most context-switching between tools, (2) Determine which actions require customer communication versus silent backend updates, (3) Map out the exact sequence of clicks/fields each macro must automate, (4) Verify no macro creates irreversible changes without confirmation, (5) Ensure customer-facing language never reveals internal processes.

# RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
Organize the macro set to cover both the user's specified repetitive tasks and additional high-frequency actions common across support teams using their platform. Each macro entry should provide:

**Section 1: Macro Identification**
- Clear, searchable name following consistent naming conventions (action-context format)
- Recommended keyboard shortcut that avoids platform default conflicts

**Section 2: Technical Execution**
- Step-by-step trigger actions the platform executes behind the scenes
- Specific field updates, tag changes, status modifications, assignment routing, and notification triggers
- Confirmation steps for any potentially irreversible actions

**Section 3: Communication Components**
- Customer-facing message (when applicable) under 75 words with [DYNAMIC_FIELD] placeholders
- Internal note template with standardized fields: action taken, agent identifier, escalation reason, next step expected
- Clear indication when macro performs silent backend updates only

**Section 4: Usage Context**
- When agents should fire this macro versus handling manually
- Common mistakes to avoid when using this macro

Build 12-15 macros total, ensuring coverage across: customer communication, ticket routing/escalation, data lookup/population, status management, documentation standardization, and cross-tool coordination.

# TASK CRITERIA:
1. Each macro must do ONE thing exceptionally well—no Swiss Army knife macros that try to handle multiple scenarios
2. Customer-facing messages must NEVER reveal internal processes, team structure, or escalation paths (avoid phrases like "I've escalated to Tier 2" or "I've tagged this for our billing team")
3. Trigger actions must be written as executable steps, not vague descriptions (specify exact field names, tag values, status changes)
4. No macro should make irreversible changes (deletions, refunds, account modifications) without requiring explicit confirmation
5. Internal notes must follow consistent formatting to enable reporting and pattern analysis
6. Macros must account for the specific platform's capabilities and limitations
7. Dynamic field placeholders must use the platform's actual merge tag syntax
8. Keyboard shortcuts must not conflict with common platform defaults (Ctrl+S for save, Ctrl+Enter for submit, etc.)
9. Macros should reduce context-switching between tools by consolidating multi-step processes
10. Avoid creating macros for tasks that happen less than 5 times per day per agent—manual handling is more efficient
11. Every macro that sends customer communication should have a corresponding internal documentation component
12. Macro names must be instantly recognizable under pressure—agents shouldn't need to remember cryptic abbreviations
13. Focus on macros that eliminate typing, clicking, and tool-switching, not just template responses
14. Build macros that prevent common errors (forgetting to tag, missing required fields, inconsistent formatting)
15. Ensure macros maintain audit trails for compliance and quality assurance

**AVOID:**
- Macros so complex they require training sessions to use
- Customer messages that sound robotic or template-like
- Internal processes that create more documentation work than they save
- Shortcuts that conflict with browser or OS defaults
- Macros that assume information not yet gathered from the customer

**FOCUS ON:**
- Eliminating the highest-frequency repetitive actions first
- Standardizing language and processes across the entire team
- Reducing average handle time without sacrificing quality
- Creating clear audit trails for escalations and handoffs
- Making the right action the easiest action for agents under pressure

# INFORMATION ABOUT ME:
- My support platform: [INSERT SUPPORT PLATFORM, e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, HubSpot Service Hub, Help Scout]
- My other tools agents use: [LIST OTHER TOOLS, e.g., Stripe for billing, Shopify admin, internal CRM, Slack for escalations]
- My daily ticket volume: [INSERT NUMBER OF TICKETS PER DAY]
- My repetitive task #1: [INSERT TASK, e.g., looking up order status and pasting tracking info]
- My repetitive task #2: [INSERT TASK, e.g., issuing standard refunds]
- My repetitive task #3: [INSERT TASK, e.g., resetting customer passwords or sending reset links]
- My repetitive task #4: [INSERT TASK, e.g., tagging and categorizing tickets]
- My repetitive task #5: [INSERT TASK, e.g., escalating to Tier 2 with context notes]
- My repetitive task #6: [INSERT TASK, e.g., sending a knowledge base article link]
- My repetitive task #7: [INSERT TASK, e.g., closing resolved tickets with a summary]

# RESPONSE FORMAT:
Present the complete macro set as a reference table with the following columns:

| Macro Name | Trigger Actions | Customer Message | Internal Note | Shortcut |

Each row should contain one complete macro with all components filled in. Use "N/A" for Customer Message when the macro performs silent backend actions only. Use bullet points within table cells for multi-step trigger actions. Include [DYNAMIC_FIELD] placeholders in customer messages using the platform's actual merge tag syntax. Format internal notes as structured templates with consistent field labels.

## How to use the prompt

Analyzes an AI prompt that creates internal support macros for customer service teams. Generates time-saving shortcuts that automate repetitive tasks like refunds, escalations, and ticket tagging. Produces a structured table with macro names, trigger actions, customer messages, internal notes, and keyboard shortcuts.
